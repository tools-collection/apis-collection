    Lettria aims to bring the processing of the French language as close as
    possible to human functioning by creating APIs based on French semantics and
    not on keywords. The Lettria team combines its scientific and technological
    skills with linguist profiles in order to deal as closely as possible with
    the specificities of the French language. They aim to make the use of NLP
    technologies accessible by offering high-performance proprietary libraries,
    high-quality educational content and demonstrating the benefits of using a
    100% French model in all sectors of activity
